        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Media Arts + Practice and Human Biology. I am interested in the intersection of medicine and design, especially with immersive technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. I also like working in the field of medical devices and I hope to pursue a progressive masters in biomedical engineering. 

        </p>
        
        <p>
        I was born and raised in San Francisco. My experience in a student medical device design club and my parents' work in the fields of biotech and medicine has definitely inspired my own interests. As well as my work in graphic design, logo design, web design and interactive design.
